# Virtual Rendering Implementations

React-Style virtual(diff and patch) rendering implementations in different programming Languages.

`langName-intro-to-lang.ext` features a quick tutorial on that specific languages syntax design
that may serve as a good way to learn a new language from the point of view of another by comparing
how the same thing is done in that language vs the language you know. 
Calls to native api's are prefixed with a comment `// ... calls native api(s)`.

### Current Implementations

- Swift
- Javascript

### TODO

- Rust
- GO

Open to pull requests for other Languages. Just include a `langName-intro-to-lang.ext` and `langName-virtual-render.ext` file.
